# flight-controller-using-teensy-4.0-micro-controller
This package is a flight controller intended to simply stabilize an otherwise unstable vehicle platform
such as a multirotor, small helicopter, or other unique VTOL platform. It may also be used to
supplement passively stable platforms such as airplanes, and can even be used on other types
of robotics projects that don’t fly. This is not a flight computer, which would handle advanced
autonomy, computer vision, or path planning. However, dRehmFlight can be modified to accept a
serial input with simulated radio pilot commands, which could be generated by a separate onboard
companion computer. This is outside the scope of this project. dRehmFlight is meant to accept
radio commands from a ground-based pilot, interpret them as vehicle state setpoints (desired vehicle
angle or rotation rate), and have the vehicle perform those commands.
The code is designed to run on a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller with the MPU6050 IMU which
together cost less than $30. The Teensy 4.0 is an extremely powerful microcontroller with 40 digital
pins, 31 of which are PWM-enabled, and all of which are interrupt capable. It’s ARM Cortex-M7
microprocessor features a 600 MHz clock speed enabling a flight control loop rate of 2 kHz with
plenty of overhead for custom code additions. The code is compiled and uploaded to the board
5
using the simple-to-use Arduino IDE and the Teensyduino add-on
