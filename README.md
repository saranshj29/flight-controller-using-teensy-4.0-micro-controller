3. **Upload**: Click the upload button in the IDE to compile and upload the code to the Teensy.

## 7. Control Logic

### 7.1 Flight Control Algorithms
The flight controller uses a series of algorithms to ensure stable flight. The primary algorithm is a PID control loop, which regulates the vehicle's orientation and altitude based on feedback from the IMU and user inputs.

### 7.2 PID Control Implementation
The PID controller continuously adjusts the control inputs based on the error between the desired state and the actual state of the vehicle. 

- **Proportional Control (P)**: Reacts to the current error.
- **Integral Control (I)**: Accumulates past errors to eliminate steady-state error.
- **Derivative Control (D)**: Predicts future errors based on the rate of change.

### 7.3 Mixing Control Outputs
The control mixer takes the outputs from the PID controllers and assigns them to the appropriate motors and servos. This allows for customized vehicle behavior based on its design. For example, a quadcopter's motors are assigned in a way that tilting the vehicle will cause the motors on one side to increase power while decreasing power on the opposite side.

## 8. Tuning and Calibration

### 8.1 Initial Calibration of the IMU
To achieve accurate flight control, the IMU must be calibrated. This involves taking multiple readings at startup and calculating offsets for the accelerometer and gyroscope.

#### Calibration Steps:
1. **Gather Raw Data**: Take several readings while the vehicle is stationary.
2. **Calculate Offsets**: Determine average values for each axis to use as calibration offsets.
3. **Apply Offsets**: Modify the code to apply these offsets during data processing.

### 8.2 PID Tuning Procedure
Tuning the PID controller is crucial for achieving responsive and stable flight. 

### 8.2 PID Tuning Procedure (continued)

**Tuning Steps:**
1. **Start with Default Values**: Begin with the recommended PID values found in the documentation or use conservative estimates. Common initial values might be:
   - **Proportional Gain (Kp)**: Start with a low value (e.g., 0.1) to see how the vehicle responds.
   - **Integral Gain (Ki)**: Set to zero initially.
   - **Derivative Gain (Kd)**: Set to zero initially as well.

2. **Increase Proportional Gain**: Gradually increase the Kp value until you observe oscillations in the vehicle's response. The goal is to find the point just before the system becomes unstable. 

3. **Introduce Integral Gain**: After determining a satisfactory Kp, slowly introduce the Ki value. This should help eliminate any steady-state error you might see after the vehicle has settled. Start with a low value (e.g., 0.01) and observe the effects.

4. **Add Derivative Gain**: Finally, introduce Kd to dampen any oscillations. This value is usually kept smaller compared to Kp. Adjusting Kd can help reduce overshoot and improve stability.

5. **Iterate**: After each adjustment, perform flight tests to evaluate performance. Note down the behavior and repeat the tuning process as necessary, adjusting one parameter at a time to observe its effects.

### 8.3 Performance Testing
Once PID gains are tuned, conduct thorough performance testing. This phase ensures that the VTOL responds accurately to user inputs and maintains stability under various conditions. 

#### Testing Scenarios:
- **Hover Test**: Check how well the vehicle maintains a stable position. Ensure it does not drift significantly in any direction.
- **Pitch and Roll Test**: Maneuver the vehicle through gentle tilts to observe how it recovers to a stable position. Ensure it responds smoothly without excessive oscillation.
- **Yaw Control**: Test the yaw control by rotating the vehicle and checking its ability to maintain a heading.
- **Transition Testing**: If the vehicle is a hybrid or transitioning model, test its ability to switch between hover and forward flight modes smoothly.

Document the performance in various scenarios to identify areas requiring further tuning.
